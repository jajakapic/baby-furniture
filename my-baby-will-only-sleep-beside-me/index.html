I have a 6 week old bub who will only sleep on my arm at night laying beside me with the boob either in her mouth or reaching distance from her lips 😂 during the day she contact naps 90% of time in the baby carrier, i am all for it as i understand she is still so little and i want to be there for her no matter what she needs but i just want to. Move baby to his crib once he’s conked out, since sleeping on a flat surface (his crib mattress) helps reduce the risk of sids. Second baby will only sleep on me : It may help baby sleep and — bonus — has been associated with a decreased risk of sids.

<p>It�s a combo of issues, mainly that she is the third baby, we are always on the go, and she has to just sleep when she. It is much more comfortable than laying flat on their backs in a crib or bassinet. To get him to nap without being held, we had him sleep on the couch right next to us at first, that way he is near you still but your not holding him. Take nap time to really look at your child, watch their chest softly rise and fall as they breathe, smell the baby scent on their breath, look at the tiny curls in their hair, stroke their foreheads and cheeks, hold their little podgy hands in yours and feel the reassuring weight of their body molding into yours.</p>
