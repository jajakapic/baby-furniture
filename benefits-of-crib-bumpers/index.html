Bumpers cushion your baby if he accidentally rolls into the side of the crib, and they can also keep him from getting body parts stuck between the slats of the crib.

And indeed, bumpers were first conceived to cover the space between crib slats so babies couldn’t fall out or get their heads, arms or legs stuck between the bars.
