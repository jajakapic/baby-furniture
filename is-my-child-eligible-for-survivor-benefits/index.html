Child’s benefits (also known as survivor�s benefits) are paid to any child that has one or more parents who are disabled, retired, or deceased. The amount of survivor benefits you are eligible for is calculated using the social security your spouse was receiving at the time they died. If you are retirement age and are applying for survivor benefits, you may be eligible for 100 percent of your spouse’s benefits. Social security survivors benefits are paid to widows, widowers, and dependents of eligible workers.
