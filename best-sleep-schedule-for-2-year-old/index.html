Realistic 2 Year Old Daily Schedule Pinecones &amp; Pacifiers From pinecones-and-pacifiers.com
School age children are still experiencing enormous growth, are very active, and require a lot of sleep. At 4 years of age, children need 11.5 hours of nighttime sleep and no longer require a daily nap, but 45 minutes of quiet time is recommended, along with the occasional nap. By the time the toddler is 3 years old, many will have given up naps totally. I generally recommend no later than 8:30pm, assuming that works with your schedule.
