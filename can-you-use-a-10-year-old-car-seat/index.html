<p>Children less than 4’9” tall would be better to use a child safety seat system. Children aged 3 or more years old, and up to 135cm (approx 4ft 5in) tall, must use an appropriate child restraint when travelling in cars or goods vehicles fitted with seat belts. Never use a child car seat that you know has been in a crash, or if you can see signs of wear or damage on any part of the seat. With a weight of also only 24 lbs, it is extremely lightweight to move from car to car.</p>
