<p>What do you do when your toddler grows out of the travel cot but isn’t yet in a proper bed? Even having less amniotic fluid causes slow growth. It might also be caused by fetal problems due to some genetic abnormalities or an infection, the fetus may have poor growth and so the problem could be with the fetus itself. Is my baby too skinny??

The matress is so thin and… little girl, big bed third story(ies).</p>

<p>Worried travel cot is too small. We got our cot and mattress from a friend and i�ve just realised that up one end the mattress is about 5cm smaller so there�s a gap, do i need to get a mattress that fits tightly to all ends?
