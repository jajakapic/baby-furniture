<p>I worked for aldi for 10 years and the pay rate was incredibly competitive to begin with, people could progress if they were good at the job and the perks gave an incentive to join the company, work hard, and stay with the company. The direction they seem to be heading to over the next 5 years or so isnt like it used to be. They pay a fair, above average, and reasonable wage.
