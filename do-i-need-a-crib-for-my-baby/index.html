Do i need a crib? Remember that for your baby’s safety, a fitted sheet is the only bedding you actually need, and don’t put additional sheets, extra blankets, stuffed animals, or bumpers in baby’s. Keep the changing table decluttered. Although a baby monitor can help, there’s nothing quite like being able to take a quick look to your side to watch baby’s chest rise and fall.
