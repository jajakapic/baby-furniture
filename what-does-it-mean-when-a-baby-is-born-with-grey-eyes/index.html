<p>If your baby has brown eyes, the melanocytes are secreting a lot of melanin. In a minority of kids, though, eye colour can keep getting darker up until age five or six.”. Over time, more dark pigment is produced, which can change your child’s eye color from blue to brown, green, gray or a mixture of colors — as is the case with hazel eyes or heterochromia.

My son�s are bright blue and they�ve gotten lighter since birth, so i�m hoping they stay blue. In reality, it’s not that the color changes, but that it begins to be defined. This is because of the pigmentation process, which continues to develop after a baby is born.</p>

If your baby has brown eyes, the melanocytes are secreting a lot of melanin. Melanin gives color to the eyes, and as baby cells cannot produce melanin, the eyes are gray. Melanin is responsible for this interesting eye color in babies.</p>
