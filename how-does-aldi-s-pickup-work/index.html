ALDI Expands Curbside Grocery Pickup to 600 Stores The Krazy Coupon Lady From thekrazycouponlady.com
An instacart shopper will bring out your groceries. How does the pick up of groceries work in general and also if i get some alcohol? Expect to pay a fee of $1.99 or more if you place an aldi curbside pickup order of less than $35 and a fee of at least $3.99 for orders over $35. I miss winking owl wine and some of their german beer so i want to get some with my other groceries.
