If you have a baby registry, take care to check and to see what baby stuff has been bought before you go out for them yourself. This generally happens between 18 and 21 weeks, but some people find out as early as 12 weeks. While some of these items are absolute necessities, some are personal preferences. However, if you don’t want to check on the gender, ensure you buy most of the unisex stuff.
