They can be quite bulky to carry, unlike sleeping mats and pads. Although travel cots are safe for babies and toddlers to sleep in for short stints, they are not designed for regular sleep over a long period of time. Travel cots are great for short stints away from home or for daytime naps, but they’re not intended for frequent use over a long period of time. Just make sure the sheets etc fit properly as some cot sheets are a different size to travel cots.

<p>Can you use a travel cot instead of a moses blanket? I also find my kids were happier. If you used it long term bubs would end up with flat spots on their head as the mattress that is provided and recommended to use to sleep on by sids is pretty hard. That�s where the sids risk comes in as the porter cots have soft.</p>

<p>Travel cots are not recommended for long term use because the mattresses are 8cm deep. I have such better peace of mind since traveling with a travel cot and they can be quite easy to fit into a regular suitcase along with your luggage. The reason travel cots aren�t recommended for long term use is the depth in the mattress, normal cot mattresses are around 8cm deep, if you get one to fit your travel cot you then have to take in to account the side�s aren�t as high so easier for them to climb or fall out.
