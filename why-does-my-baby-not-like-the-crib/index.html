<p>If your little one doesn’t know how to put herself to sleep and relies on you for that, she will communicate in the only way she knows how and that is through crying. This is especially true if she fell asleep safe in your arms and is now moving through space. Sometimes when your baby won’t nap in crib it’s because the very idea is foreign.

<p>Eventually your baby will think of the crib as a fun place to be. A lot of the hard wiring is happening during sleep, so that�s why you�ll find them sitting up in their crib, or soon pulling up on the rail but unable to get back down. Throughout the day — not at sleep times — put some of their favorite toys in the crib. What Will My Baby Look Like? Science Can Provide Some Clues.</p>
<h3 id="eventually-your-baby-will-think-of-the-crib-as-a-fun-place-to-be">Eventually Your Baby Will Think Of The Crib As A Fun Place To Be.</h3><p>Remember, though you cannot entirely change or fix a baby really bent on avoiding the crib, there are some things you can consider doing. Because when you put them down into the cot/crib you trigger an alerting reflex. Make sure that your baby’s bassinet or crib has a firm mattress. It might take him anywhere from a few days up to a few weeks, but eventually he’ll learn how to get down without your help.</p>
<h3 id="the-very-act-of-putting-a-baby-down-into-the-cot-or-crib-causes-their-falling-reflex-to-trigger-startling-them-awake-because-of-the-presence-of-imminent-danger-falling">The Very Act Of Putting A Baby Down, Into The Cot Or Crib, Causes Their Falling Reflex To Trigger, Startling Them Awake Because Of The Presence Of Imminent Danger (Falling).</h3><p>Make a game out of reaching in and getting them out. Then all of a suddenly on day 3, your little one has developed a newfound aversion for his or her crib. They prefer when the baby is in the crib, the baby should be sleeping not staring at the mobile. The tantrum is to refuse sleeping in the crib.</p>
<h3 id="swaddling-can-help-baby-feel-more-secure-since-the-swaddle-sort-of-feels-like-moms-arms-or-like-the-coziness-of-the-sling-or-baby-swing">Swaddling Can Help Baby Feel More Secure, Since The Swaddle Sort Of Feels Like Mom’s Arms, Or Like The Coziness Of The Sling Or Baby Swing.</h3><p>As the days go by, you should spend less time in the room, and you can begin interacting with them from the doorway of the room. That’s no way for sweet babes to take in this brand new world. Wide cribs can make babies feel disoriented and confused as they can’t feel coziness. If your little one doesn’t know how to put herself to sleep and relies on you for that, she will communicate in the only way she knows how and that is through crying.</p>
<h3 id="sometimes-when-your-baby-wont-nap-in-crib-its-because-the-very-idea-is-foreign">Sometimes When Your Baby Won’t Nap In Crib It’s Because The Very Idea Is Foreign.</h3><p>As you begin to make this transition, feel free to stand by the crib, sing to your little one and stroke or pat them. Throughout the day — not at sleep times — put some of his favorite toys in the crib. If the space where your crib/bassinet is set up isn�t promoting of sleep. Keep things dark and soothing.</p>
