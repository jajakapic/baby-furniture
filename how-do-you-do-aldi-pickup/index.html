Does Aldi Save You as Much Money as They Claim? Clark Howard From clark.com
An item is out of stock and you’re refunded. Aldi generally charges a fee of $1.99 (at least in my area) for using their curbside pickup service. Select aldi as your store, and you will be taken to aldi’s main page on the instacart app. $35.22 subtotal &#43; $1.99 pickup fee &#43; $2.59 sales tax = $39.80 total.
