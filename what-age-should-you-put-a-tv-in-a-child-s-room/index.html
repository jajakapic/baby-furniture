Another reason is if you watch too much tv it can lead to obesity and other health problems. I have the remote and i determine when and for how long they watch tv. I like to know what my kids, who range in age from four to 14, are watching, so we have one tv—and it’s in our tv room. I�ve been watching tv for as long as i remember but i don�t remember exactly what age.

<p>Television can help new parents fight sleep during the late nights and early mornings, distract them from how tired they are, and provide some entertainment. I have 4 children, ages 4, 20 months, and 10 month twins. Children who have a television or video games in their bedroom spend less time reading and sleeping, research suggests. The last reason is kids can stay up all night and watch innapropiate shows.</p>

<p>In a study of 80 children, ages 4 to 7, the presence of a television in the bedroom increased average viewing time by nearly nine hours a week, to 30 hours from 21. It was also found that the parents of these children were more likely to underestimate their child’s viewing. The only way they can watch tv is if they have the remote.

<p>I guess i am in the minority here. By some estimates, about half of american children have bedroom tvs. According to a 2012 study, not only does the incidence of obesity increase with each hour of tv a child watches in a day, but having a television in a child�s bedroom was proven to impact a child�s weight to a greater degree than any other single factor, including race, age, and socioeconomic status. .</p>

<p>I agree (in theory) with most of the reasons presented here for not allowing a tv in a child’s bedroom. However this is an old tv hooked up to satellite via the main satellite box in our living room. You may also have less control over what they watch. 201401.</p>

<p>I guess i am in the minority here. While there are benefits to having a tv in the nursery, the negative effects outweigh the pros. I�ve always been against the girls playing in their rooms and believe they go there to sleep, but now i�m thinking would it be such a bad thing for a quiet dvd in the afternoon.

<p>One reason is a bedroom is for sleeping not for watching tv.
