Your 7MonthOld Baby Development, Sleep, Feeding, Fun Play! From easybabylife.com
I walked around my house with a lovey in my ample nursing cleavage. Don�t let your baby sleep with any soft objects until he�s at least 12 months old. First, the loveys should sleep in the parent’s bed to absorb their smell for a while. A lovey blanket or toy can help kids sleep.
