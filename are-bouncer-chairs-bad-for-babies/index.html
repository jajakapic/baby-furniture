Bouncers should only be reserved for small infants. Always supervise a baby using a swing or a bouncer. Some babies can sit up on their own as early as 4 months. I dont see anything wrong with baby bouncers at all if its going to keep her amused and im sure they are safe , my own dds had them well 1 had a swing other had a bouncer and they loved it and if you live in a small flat like i do then you are never going to be that far away from her.
