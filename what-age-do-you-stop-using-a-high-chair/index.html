That Standing Desk Might Not Be The Magical Solution Shots Health From npr.org
When you start noticing your toddler is sitting upright comfortably then you can stop using the high chair during mealtimes. The reason is that at this age, they should be steady enough to keep themselves upright for quite a long period, though the chances of being wiggly might be there. There is no fixed age when children should be out of a high chair and transition to a booster seat. And finally, your baby might sit up without assistance at the age of 12 months.
